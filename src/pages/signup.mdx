# Let's get you started

<Logo>POW!</Logo> Uses [Userbase](https://userbase.com/) under the hood.

<UserForm variant="signUp" />

In a privacy first application like POW! there is no
password recovery. So remember to save the password you
choose somewhere safe.

If you are not using a password manager I (@raae) highly
recomend you start. My personal favorite is
[1Password](https://1password.com/).
