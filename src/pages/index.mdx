# Your personal cycle

POW! adapts to **your cycle**, and **your level** of
interest. You track as many or as few factors as you like
using tags.

Tags are used by POW! to predict what is normal for you at
any given time in your cycle.

You can also create custom reports (coming soon) to analyze
how the different factors play out throughout your cycle.

# Your personal data

POW! is a **privacy-first** app. You keep complete control
of your data. It is never ever shared with any third
parties.

Under the hood POW! uses the [Blockstack](/#blockstack)
platform.

All data is encrypted before being stored locally and before
sending it to your personal storage hub.

# Blockstack

Blockstack empowers developers like me to create privacy
first apps, like POW!, for you. Blockstack gives you
complete control of your identity and your data.

Check out [blockstack.org](https://blockstack.org/) for more
information. Heads up, it's for the more technically
inclined amongst you.

They also help fund apps through their
[App Mining program](https://app.co/mining). You can help me
get some of those funds by supporting POW! on
[Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/pow-3) or
spreading some POW! love in social media.

# Open beta

POW! is being developed as we speak. This means everything
is not up to the standard I would like yet. Some key
features are still around the corner and you must prepare
yourself for sudden user interface changes.

But if you, as I, believe in a menstrual cycle tracker that
lets us be in charge of our cycles and our personal data,
please start using POW! and hit me up on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/raae) or
[email](mailto:pow@raae.codes) with your feedback and
suggestions.
